# OCR + LLM or Multimodal Models? PaliGemma2 Fine-Tuning with QLoRA on a Custom Dataset for Text Understanding inÂ Images

![](imagens/image.jpg)

The repository contains the implementation of fine-tuning PalliGema2 using QLoRA for a specific task. It includes three key Jupyter notebooks: Custom_Dataset.ipynb, which is responsible for preparing and managing the custom dataset; FT_Paligemma.ipynb, which handles the fine-tuning process; and Inf_Paligemma.ipynb, which is used for inference. These notebooks provide a complete workflow for adapting the model to the desired use case.
